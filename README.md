Welcome to
Episode 6: Wut!zLØv3??? 
a conjuration of rumination 
via interactive virtual karaoke.  

The incantation, set to the song 
“What is Love?” By Haddaway, 
begins at 5 PM in Vienna/11 AM in New York 
and runs until I, Qasi BABb Pink, 
reach the point of physical exhaustion.  
I welcome you to participate along side me 
or simply explore 
the enigmatic inner machinations 
of my virtual mind devoid of logic.

It will be “Fricken’ Bats!” 
(whatever that memes?)
and definitely not overwhelming
in the slightest 😘

Yours devotedly and lovingly,
Qasi BABb Pink

Ps. What is love?
I worry I may be trapped 
here until I figure that out 
and the internet keeps telling me to 
listen to this song 
and I fear it does not have
the answer.

You, f683c8, 00cc22, 2200cc, Magic Texture Node, not hdmi, anyone
